    "1. **Trip Duration Distribution**:\n",
    "   - The histogram of trip durations shows that most trips are relatively short, with a long tail extending towards longer durations. This indicates that the majority of bike rides are quick, but there are also a significant number of longer rides.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **User Type Distribution**:\n",
    "   - The pie chart reveals that subscribers significantly outnumber customers, with subscribers being nearly nine times more common. This suggests a high level of engagement among regular users.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Age Group Usage**:\n",
    "   - The bar plot indicates which age groups are most active in using the bike-sharing service. The plot helps in understanding the distribution of bike usage across different age ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Correlation Insights**:\n",
    "   - The heatmap shows a very weak positive correlation between ride duration and user age, and no significant correlation between ride duration and the latitude of the starting station. This suggests that age and starting station location have minimal impact on ride duration."
